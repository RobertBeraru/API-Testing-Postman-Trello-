# API Testing Showcase Project

# Introduction
Welcome to my API testing showcase project! This project serves as a demonstration of my skills and proficiency in testing the Trello APIs using Postman. Throughout this endeavor, I have aimed to showcase my ability to design, execute, and document comprehensive API tests.

# Project Highlights
- **API Coverage:** I have conducted a total of 48 tests covering a wide range of functionalities provided by the Trello API. These tests include scenarios for creating boards, managing lists and cards, handling members, and more.

- **HTTP Methods:** The tests utilize various HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, to ensure a thorough examination of each API endpoint. This approach helps in validating the functionality and reliability of the Trello API.

- **Test Execution Schedule:** To streamline the testing process, I have organized a test execution schedule based on the priority of API functionalities. This prioritization ensures that critical features are rigorously tested first, allowing for a more efficient testing process.

- **CRUD Methodology:** As part of this showcase, I have implemented a test case following the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methodology. This structured approach provides a comprehensive validation of the API's capabilities across different entities.

# Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- **Test Scripts:** The test scripts are organized to cover specific functionalities, making it easy to understand and navigate through the testing scenarios.

- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation accompanies each test script, providing insights into the purpose of the test, expected outcomes, and any specific considerations.

- **Execution Logs:** Logs from test executions, including successful runs and any identified issues, are available for review.

# Conclusion
This showcase project is a testament to my expertise in API testing, highlighting the depth and breadth of my skills. I believe in delivering high-quality results through meticulous testing processes and effective documentation.
